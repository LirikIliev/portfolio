# Information for Calculator application

It's a standard math calculator. You can use simple math functions on it, like: "Sum", "Divide", "Multiply", "Subtract";
You also can take a square of a number and "work" with it, and reverse the number from positive to negative or opposite, decimal mark is also available.

For this application, I used vanilla JavaScript.

# Run app

To run app you just need to start "index.html" file with 'live servers'. If you don't have one, please install extension "Live Server".
